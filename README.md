# Overview

The player can control a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane,
picking up food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area.
Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer and the score increases by 1 point. Also, 
after the fruit is eaten the new fruit will appear in a random location of a playing field.
Game controls: keyboard arrows up, down, left, right (← → ↓ ↑) control the direction of a snake
c - continue the game, q- quit the game.

I decided to write this game in order to learn game frameworks and master my programming skills
in a different language. I used PyGame as my gaming framework.

# Development Environment

I chose PyCharm community edition as my development environment because it has great debugging tools
such as: code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester.

I used Python as a programing language. Also, I used pygame, time, and random libraries.
pygame - to use graphics and game window.
time - to speed up a snake to make the game harder.
random - to generate objects at a random location in the game.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add different levels of difuculty
* Add some objects that will reduce the tail of a snake if a snake hit them
* Add more graphics
